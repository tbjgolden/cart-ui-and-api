## What did you think of this test/exercise?

### What did you like?

1. I liked the idea of providing a sketch file

### What could be improved?

1. Should be shortened from 9-12hrs to 3hrs of work
2. The assignment leaves little room for individual creativity and demonstrating the more unique skills
3. Sketch is only a Mac-only tool - I use Linux on my main PC. This meant I had to convert it to Figma to use it. Perhaps a Figma design would be a more sensible way of sharing it with candidates

### What didn't you like?

1. Was long
2. Wasn't challenging
3. This project is 5 years old now and is pretty dated - it's not v relevant to modern web dev

If I'm honest, this test was very disappointing.

It's largely put me off from working with the company and it shouldn't be like that.

I understand that writing this is only likely to harm my chances of working at the company, but I feel like I have to get it off my chest as I can only imagine it must be putting other candidates off!
